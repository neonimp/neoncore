# NeonCore

NeonCore is a utility library for working with binary data in rust.

It was created primarily for me to centralize code that is shared between my projects,
however feel free to use it if you find it useful.

Request features and report bugs on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/neonimp/neoncore/issues).
